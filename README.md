Combining magic, mentalism trick with AI. This is my first NLP project. 



# Magic_trick_structure : 

A magician has a board covered with cloth. Firstly, without any force, a spectator freely chooses a playing card from a deck of cards. Then, surprisingly the prediction board from earlier shows the card that the spectator had been chosen 


# behind the magic trick:

This trick includes IOT board as a monitor linked with a microphone attached to the cheek (mouth microphone) has ASR ability. Let's say if a spectator chooses Ace of spade. A magician says " Are you sure you choose Ace of spade. Do you wanna change?" while he talks that sentence his mouth microphone knows the keywords "ace of spade". Then the microphone sends data to the monitor board, The monitor board displays the card that the spectator had been chooen.
