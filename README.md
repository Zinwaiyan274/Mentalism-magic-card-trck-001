This trick includes IOT board as a monitor linked with a microphone attached to the cheek (mouth microphone) has NLP ability. Let's say if a spectator chooses Ace of spade. A magician says " Are you sure you choose Ace of spade. Do you wanna change?" while he talks that sentence his mouth microphone knows the keywords "ace of spade". Then the microphone sends data to the monitor board, The monitor board displays the card that the spectator had been chooen.
